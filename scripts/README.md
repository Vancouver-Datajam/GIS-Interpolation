# Scripts directory

Use this script to store any R, Bash or Python scripts you developed. This includes:

1. Apps
2. Data donwload and clean up scripts
3. Data visualization scripts
4. Machine learning pipelines

## Required sections

### Set up

Ensure you have the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `pykrige`, and `plotly`) installed in your Python environment.

### Command line parameters (if applicable) or code snippets demonstrating code usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from ftplib import FTP
from io import BytesIO
from pykrige.ok import OrdinaryKriging
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go
usage
```

### Script considerations and limitations

#### Limitations:

1. **Assumes CSV Format:**
   - assumes that the climate data is provided in a CSV format. If the data is stored in a different format, additional data loading and parsing steps may be necessary.

2. **FTP Access Required:**
   - relies on FTP access to retrieve the data. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and credentials to access the FTP server.

3. **Error Handling**

4. **Data Validation**

#### Considerations:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - additional preprocessing steps (e.g., outlier detection, missing value imputation) may be required before performing Kriging.

2. **Spatial Grid Resolution:**
   - The grid resolution used for Kriging can impact the accuracy and granularity of the interpolated results. Adjust this based on your specific requirements.

3. **Kriging Parameters:**
   - The Kriging model's parameters (e.g., variogram model, nugget, sill, range) may need to be fine-tuned to optimize the interpolation results for your dataset.

4. **Visualization Customization:**
   - The Plotly visualization can be customized to enhance clarity and aesthetics, including labels, color scales, and additional annotations.

5. **Documentation and Comments:**
   - Comprehensive comments and documentation are crucial for understanding and maintaining the script over time. Include explanations for key steps and parameter choices.

6. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Thoroughly test the script with different datasets and scenarios to ensure robustness and accuracy of the results.

### Starting Script
This script connects to the FTP server, and downloads the CSV file. 

```python
# Define FTP connection parameters
ftp_server = 'ftp.example.com'
ftp_user = 'your_username'
ftp_password = 'your_password'
file_path = '/path/to/your/climate_data.csv'

# Connect to FTP server and download the CSV file
ftp = FTP(ftp_server)
ftp.login(user=ftp_user, passwd=ftp_password)
ftp.retrbinary(f'RETR {file_path}', open('climate_data.csv', 'wb').write)
ftp.quit()

# Load the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('climate_data.csv')
```
