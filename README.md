# Visualization & Prediction of Geospatial BC Climates

## Project statement
The aim of this project is to harness the power of data analysis and geospatial techniques to provide accurate visualizations and predictions of climatic conditions across various regions of British Columbia (BC). By employing Kriging interpolation on a carefully curated point dataset, we seek to create a detailed representation of BC's climate patterns. Additionally, we will develop an interactive geospatial dashboard using Plotly, enabling users to explore and understand the climatic variations in an intuitive and informative manner.

### Key Tasks
- **Kriging Interpolation**: Implement the Kriging interpolation method to estimate climate values at unobserved locations.
Evaluate and fine-tune the interpolation model for optimal results.
- **Geospatial Dashboard Development**: Utilize Python and Plotly to create an interactive geospatial dashboard.
Incorporate visual elements like maps, charts, and filters for a user-friendly experience.
- **Visualization and Interpretation**: Present the interpolated climate data through visually appealing and informative plots and maps.
Provide insights and context for interpreting the climatic patterns observed.
- **Prediction and Analysis**: Enable users to input coordinates or select locations on the dashboard to receive predicted climate values.
Offer insights into how the climate varies across different regions of British Columbia.

### Deliverables:
- A well-documented Python codebase that encompasses the entire data analysis process, from data acquisition to dashboard development.
- An interactive geospatial dashboard powered by Plotly, providing easy access to climate information for different regions of BC.
- Documentation detailing the methodology, code structure, and instructions for running the project.

### Conclusion
This project presents an exciting opportunity to combine advanced data analysis techniques with geospatial visualization, offering a valuable resource for understanding and predicting climate patterns in British Columbia. Through this endeavor, we aim to contribute to a better-informed understanding of the climatic conditions in this diverse and ecologically significant region.
